## Visualizing some results from scientific initiation

Through this post it is possible to observe the best models achieved based on the AUC metrics
during my first scientific initiation.

You can check more details mainly through these shinyapps:

Using bioclimatic variables from WorldClim 2.1 and other terrain variables selected through VIF method:
[Suitability Map - Geographical filtering](https://bnutmodelling.shinyapps.io/vif_vars_geog/)
Future projections using CMIP6 scenarios:
[Future Projections - scenarios (SSP245 & SSP585)](https://bideco.shinyapps.io/futur3/)


Using bioclimatic variables from WorldClim 1.4 and terrain variables selected through VIF method:
[Suitability Map - Geographical Filtering](https://bideco.shinyapps.io/cmip5_prsent/)
Future projections using CMIP5 scenarios:
[Future Projections - scenarios (RCP45 & RCP85)](https://bnutmodelling.shinyapps.io/future_cmip5/)


Using bioclimatic variables from WorldClim 2.1 and other terrain variables selected through VIF method:
[Suitability Map - Environmental filtering](https://bideco.shinyapps.io/vif_vars_env/)
Future projections using CMIP6 scenarios:
[Future Projections - scenarios (SSP245 & SSP585)](https://bnutmodelling.shinyapps.io/future_env/)


Using that last one we've got this projection for the future of Amazon nut trees for SSP245 scenario:
