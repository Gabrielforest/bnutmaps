## Visualizing some results from scientific initiation

Through this post it is possible to observe the best models achieved based on the metrics AUC
during my first scientific initiation.

You can check more details mainly through these shinyapps:

Using bioclimatic variables from WorldClim 2.1 and other terrain variables selected through VIF method:
